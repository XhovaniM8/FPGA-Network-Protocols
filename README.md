# FPGA Network Protocols

## Introduction

Welcome to the FPGA Network Protocols project! This project aims to implement various network protocols on an FPGA board, specifically the Arty Z10. The goal is to explore and demonstrate the functionality of network protocols such as ARP, ICMP, UDP, TCP, AVB, and more in a hardware-centric environment.
